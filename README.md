**What I Learned from This Project**

* Through this project, I gained practical experience with the following concepts:

* Fetching Data from APIs: I learned how to use the fetch method to retrieve data from external APIs, specifically the Deck of Cards API, to dynamically interact with a dataset.

* Async/Await: I improved my understanding of asynchronous programming by implementing async and await to handle API requests and ensure the proper flow of the application.

* DOM Manipulation: I practiced dynamically updating the DOM to reflect changes in the game's state, such as updating scores, displaying card images, and modifying text content.

* Event Handling: I became more comfortable with JavaScript event listeners to create interactive features like the "New Deck" and "Draw Cards" buttons.

* Game Logic: I implemented game logic to compare card values, determine a winner, and handle end-of-game scenarios.
